  successStories: [
{
  name: "Mohammed Ismail",
  location: "Rohingya Refugee Camp, Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh",
  achievement: "Became a Full-Stack Developer without a computer—learning everything on a basic mobile phone. Created Myanmar Book Space, an educational platform that provides textbooks and learning resources to thousands of students, along with a blood donation platform that helps families during emergency situations.",
  challenges: "Learning to code with only a phone, unstable internet, frequent power cuts, the noise and chaos of camp life, and no access to proper tools or formal training. Balancing education, responsibilities, and emotional weight while living in exile.",
  barriers: "No laptop or PC, no mentors, no financial support, extremely limited opportunities, and constant uncertainty. Every skill and every project came from self-learning, perseverance, and the belief that someone from a refugee camp can still create real solutions.",
  quote: "I built Myanmar Book Space and my other platforms with almost nothing—just a phone, determination, and hope. If thousands of people can learn, grow, and get support from what I created, then every struggle was worth it."
