  title: "From a Refugee Camp to Full-Stack Developer: My Journey of Resilience and Purpose",
  description: "How I turned a simple mobile phone, endless challenges, and a dream into real platforms that help thousands.",
  fullDescription: "My story begins in the Rohingya refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh—a place defined by struggle, scarcity, and survival. Growing up in exile with no computer, no powerful tools, and no formal learning environment, I carried a quiet but unbreakable dream: to educate myself and build something meaningful for my community.\n\nI began learning web development using nothing but a basic mobile phone and unstable internet. Every lesson was a battle—power cuts, limited resources, no mentors, and the emotional weight of camp life. I wrote my first lines of code sitting in darkness, and I continued even when everything around me seemed designed to stop me.\n\nDespite the barriers, I became a Full-Stack Developer. But my goal was never just to code—it was to solve real problems. That purpose led me to create **Myanmar Book Space**, an educational platform that now supports thousands of students struggling with textbook shortages and limited learning resources. I later built a Blood Donation Platform, connecting donors and patients during emergencies and offering hope in critical moments.\n\nMy journey is not one of comfort, but one of resilience—proving that even in the hardest conditions, knowledge can grow, solutions can be built, and hope can lead to real change.",
